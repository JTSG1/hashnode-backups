I've recently subscribed to the ChatGPT plus plan as I've been curious about the enhanced capabilities offered through that. So far I've been fairly impressed it seems to offer much more accuracy than GPT-3.5 and I appreciate the fact you can tailor the answers by providing more information about yourself and how you would like it to communicate with you. I'm still yet to fully leverage the capabilities as I've only subscribed recently but I can see it will be a useful tool.

My favourite animal is the Cheetah and I also like birds of prey. I like a neon-themed desktop environment so I thought I'd test the Dall.E 3 capabilities and get it to generate some wallpapers for me. I'm quite satisfied with the results. Sharing them in case anyone else would like to use them. I do admit, it's a random combination!
